# Passwor Manager using Python


## **This project achieves the following:**
- Creates a secure database in which the user can hold passwords or sensitive information
- The passwords remain in the database even if the program or the machine is closed
- Passwords can be added or deleted (if the user wants to delete a password a pop-up will appear and ask for confirmation in order to avoid mistakes)
- The database is accesed using a master password selected by the user (which can later be reset using the recovery key)
- The data is encrypted using SHA256

## **To be added in the near future:**
- Password generation; the users will be able to generate passwords and store them securely
- Copy; The users will be able to copy the passwords (as well as other data such as ID or website) in order to paste them instead of typing
- Search/Lookup; The users will be able to search for the passwords that corresponds to a specific ID/Username or Website
- Favorites/Most used; The users will be able to make certain passwords (that correspond to their most used websites/IDs) appear to the top of list
- Application; The program will be transformed into an application in order to be used by users who are not familiar with coding
