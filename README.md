# Passwor Manager using Python


## **This project achieves the following:**
- Creates a secure database in which the user can hold passwords or sensitive information
- The passwords remain in the database even if the program or the machine is closed
- Password generation
- Copy Password functionality
- Search/Lookup for websites and usernames
- Passwords can be added or deleted (if the user wants to delete a password a pop-up will appear and ask for confirmation in order to avoid mistakes)
- The database is accesed using a master password selected by the user (which can later be reset using the recovery key)
- The data is encrypted using SHA256
